   source directory
      The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all
      source files for one Sphinx project.

   environment
      A structure where information about all documents under the root is
      saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled
      after the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read
      and parse new and changed documents.

   channel
      The fundamental identity on the grid. Channels can make connections with other channels to share information with highly detailed permissions.
